# HTML Scrapper With Notifications

### Purpose
Wanted to buy some new boulder shoes which did not have my size available, I created a simple application which queries content from specific HTML websites periodically. Depending on defined criteria it will notify through telegram or email if the needed product is available or not.

### Additional notes
Deployed in AWS elastic beanstalk, all notifications go to [t.me/itemrestockednotifier](t.me/itemrestockednotifier).
